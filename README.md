# ServiceDiscoveryWorkout
I created this repository to save my progress about understanding Service Discovery concept. Let get started.

- i need a caseðŸ“Œ
- it looks like a subtopic of **[Microservice Architecture](https://www.edureka.co/blog/interview-questions/microservices-interview-questions/#workingofmicroservices)**
- Service Discovery â€“> A guide to find the route of communication between microservices.[Â¹][1]
- Why Do Microservices Need an API Gateway?[ðŸ”—][2]
## Keywords
Eureka, Service Registry, API Gateway, Clients, Identity Providers, Consul, Ocelot[Â¹][1],OpenId
## Samples
### [Sample 1](Samples/Eureka-Service-Discovery-Example-master/README.md) 
in this sample. there is 3 csprojects communicates eachother. AService, BService, CService. this is a basic example with Netflix Eureka. 2 of them i,s API and one for console project. 

<!-- TODO: Commit -->
<!-- TODO: research new example -->
### [Sample 2](Samples/Ocelot.Gateway.Eureka.ServiceDiscovery.Demo-main/README.md)
Service discovery with eureka is used via an api gateway with ocelot. 
<!-- I need an example whic implements also authentication with api gateway and service discovery -->

This project is aimed at people using .NET running a micro services / service oriented architecture that need a unified point of entry into their system. However it will work with anything that speaks HTTP and run on any platform that ASP.NET Core supports."
